## Automatic Windows Junk Cleaner

### Overview
A Windows application that automatically runs in the background of your Windows Operating System Device to routinely clean up Junk files, save storage/space and improve performance, without you having to do it manually every time. Junk files are temporary files that were created so that your computer/device could perform a task, such as opening a document, viewing an image, or browsing the internet. These files are useful in the moment, but once they’ve served their purpose they’re just junk, system junk files that clog up a device and cause poor performance.
