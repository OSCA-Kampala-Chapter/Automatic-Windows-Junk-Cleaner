## Windows Junk Cleaner Service (Deprecated)
This project has been deprecated. View the updated version of this project [here](https://github.com/RonnieLutaro/Windows-Junk-Cleaner-Service)
### Overview
A [Windows Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/workers) that automatically runs in the background of your Windows Operating System Device to routinely clean up Junk files, save storage/space and improve performance, without you having to do it manually every time. Junk files are temporary files that were created so that your computer/device could perform a task, such as opening a document, viewing an image, or browsing the internet. These files are useful in the moment, but once they’ve served their purpose they’re just junk, system junk files that clog up a device and cause poor performance.
