### Overview
A  free solution that automatically runs in the background of your Windows Operating System Device to routinely clean up Junk files, save storage/space and improve performance, without you having to do it manually every time. Junk files are temporary files that were created so that your computer/device could perform a task, such as opening a document, viewing an image, or browsing the internet. These files are useful at the moment, but once they’ve served their purpose, they’re just junk, system junk files that clog up a device and cause poor performance.

This means that you don't necessarily have to spend time worrying about manually managing their windows device junk-related performance issues or installing resource hungry utilities that hog up all your system memory anymore. Instead, you’ll now focus that precious time on solving other more important problems because Windows Junk Cleaner helps you take care of that and it does all this quietly in the background without hogging up all your system resources like other alternatives out there, many of which are not even free on top of hogging your system resources. As professionals, while working with our Windows device, we want to spend our most valuable time working on more critical problems instead. Resultantly, making you more productive.
