### Overview
A free solution that automatically runs in the background of your Windows Operating System Device to routinely clean up Junk files, save storage/space and improve performance, without you having to do it manually every time. This means you don't have to worry about your device's junk-related performance issues while you work, helping you focus on other more important tasks or your work. Windows Junk Cleaner does all this quietly in the background without hogging up all your system resources. Junk files are temporary files that were created so that your computer/device could perform a task, such as opening a document, viewing an image, or browsing the internet. These files are useful in the moment, but once they’ve served their purpose they’re just junk, system junk files that clog up a device and cause poor performance.
