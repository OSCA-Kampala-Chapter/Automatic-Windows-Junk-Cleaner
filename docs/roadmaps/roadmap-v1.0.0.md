# Windows Musawo v1.0.0 Roadmap

This article will address the roadmap for the Windows Musawo application, including areas of investment we’re prioritizing and for upcoming releases of Windows Musawo.

Windows Musawo is a free solution that automatically runs in the background of your Windows Operating System Device to routinely clean up Junk files, save storage/space and improve performance, without you having to do it manually every time. Junk files are temporary files that were created so that your computer/device could perform a task, such as opening a document, viewing an image, or browsing the internet. These files are useful at the moment, but once they’ve served their purpose, they’re just junk, system junk files that clog up a device and cause poor performance.

This means that you don't necessarily have to spend time worrying about manually managing your windows device junk-related performance issues or installing resource hungry utilities that hog up all your system memory anymore. Instead, you’ll now focus that precious time on solving other more important problems because Windows Musawo helps you take care of that and it does all this quietly in the background without hogging up all your system resources like other alternatives out there, many of which are not even free on top of hogging your system resources. As professionals, while working with our Windows device, we want to spend our most valuable time working on more critical problems instead. Resultantly, making us more productive.

Below is an outline of the features and improvements that are planned for this release, which is targeted for 27th February 2023.

### Areas of Investment

Our core development team will be focussing on the following areas for the next releases.

**Disk Cleanup**: The goal is to have an optimization tool with full autonomy. The Optimization tool intends to work silently in the background of the user's device to routinely clean junk files that can slow down a user's device and internet browsers while doing all this without user's manual intervention. While achieving full autonomy of the optimization tool is our goal. We don't want to sacrifice performace and thereby prioritize performance and avoid hogging up alot of system resources.

**Custom Settings**: The user is our main focus and is the center of our motivation. A custom user experience with Windows Musawo is one of the main things. We are incorporating various custom user settings to enable the user customize the level of autonomy they might prefer the optimization tool to take on among others. Despite having the default settings for autononomous Disk clean up that our team recomends, We are giving the user the power to choose. This will enable them keep in control of their user experience.

**Memory Optimization**: Similarly, the goal is to have full autonomy for memory optimization. If you use too much memory, or build up too much memory with a program running over time, performance is going to degrade. Using too much memory without releasing it to the heap (the virtual memory available as a resource to all programs) can result in running out of memory on the machine, requiring a reboot and potentially leading to many issues.

Ideally, in a well-written program, you use memory and then return it to the heap. That way there is always something on the heap to take from. Each program is allocated a piece of the heap. If a particular program (or programs) keep sucking up a disproportionate amount of the heap, program performance suffers until an eventual crash.

## In conclusion

We hope you are as excited about these features as we are! Of course, it is still early in the release and these plans are subject to change, but you can follow along with the latest status of these features by [tracking the action on GitHub](https://github.com/OSCA-Kampala-Chapter/Windows-Musawo). Major updates and changes will be shared in an article when necessary. You can also get live updates and participate in the conversation by joining and sharing your thoughts or request to join our Whatsapp group from [our Discussions section](https://github.com/OSCA-Kampala-Chapter/Windows-Musawo/discussions).
